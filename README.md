# Toras
Toras is a general purpose file transfer tool designed for quick and convenient file transfers within local directories or FTP servers. It allows users to use a total of three modifiers (including the default modifier) to transfer files to three different locations and an additional modifier specifically for use with FTP servers.

An example of a good use case for Toras is to pair it with a torrent client that utilises monitoried directories for the loading of torrents. Toras can be used to load torrent files into a local machine's monitored directory (setup within torrent client) or even that of a download server through the use of shared directories.

Users are able to search their file system and designate specific directories for each key modifier.

Files can be transferred by dragging the files onto the Toras executable or by setting the default 'Open with:' for file extensions to Toras.
